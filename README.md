## **🚀 Introduction**  
**Personal Fitness Tracker** is an AI-powered web application that helps users track workouts and predict calories burned based on their workout type, duration, and intensity.  

🔹 **Problem Statement:** Most fitness apps provide generic tracking, but lack **personalized calorie burn predictions**.  
🔹 **Solution:** Our ML model analyzes **age, weight, workout type, and duration** to give **accurate insights**.  

---

## **✨ Features**  
✅ **Predict Calories Burned** using ML models  
✅ **Interactive UI** powered by Streamlit  
✅ **Supports Multiple Exercises** (Running, Swimming, Yoga, etc.)  
✅ **Machine Learning-Based Recommendations**  
✅ **Deployed on Streamlit Cloud** for easy access

## **📂 Project Workflow**  
1️⃣ **Data Collection & Preprocessing**: Create a dataset of exercises, duration, and calories burned  
2️⃣ **Feature Engineering**: Convert categorical data into numerical format using one-hot encoding  
3️⃣ **Model Training**: Train and compare SVM, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest models  
4️⃣ **Model Evaluation**: Select the best model based on Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R² Score  
5️⃣ **Web Application**: Use Streamlit for an interactive UI  
6️⃣ **Deployment**: Host the project on **Streamlit Cloud**

## **📊 Model Performance**  
The trained **Random Forest model** achieved:  

✅ **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: **40.89**  
✅ **R² Score**: **0.85**  

| **Model**              | **MAE (Lower is Better)** | **R² Score (Higher is Better)** |  
|-----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|  
| **SVM**               | 45.12                 | 0.78                 |  
| **Logistic Regression** | 52.34                 | 0.72                 |  
| **Random Forest**      | 40.89                 | 0.85                 |  

---

## **🚀 Future Enhancements**  
🔹 **Real-time tracking** using wearable devices (e.g., Fitbit, Apple Watch)  
🔹 **AI-powered workout recommendations**  
🔹 **User profile management** for personalized fitness plans  
🔹 **Cloud storage support** to sync workout data across devices
